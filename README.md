The Problem


The data provided by Pizza Runner exhibits several challenges that hinder meaningful analysis:

Unstructured and Dirty Data: The customer_orders table includes columns for ingredient exclusions and extras that are not properly formatted. The runner_orders table contains missing values for distances, durations, and cancellation reasons.

Operational Inefficiencies: The startup struggles to track the efficiency of its runners, such as the time taken to deliver pizzas, order cancellation patterns, and customer satisfaction. Metrics related to delivery distances and times need to be standardized for meaningful evaluation.

Inventory Management Issues: The company lacks insights into topping usage for its pizzas, which complicates inventory management and cost optimization.

Customer Behavior Insights: There is no clear analysis of customer preferences, such as popular pizza types and combinations of toppings, which could drive menu optimization.

Data Inconsistencies: Some tables, such as pizza_recipes and pizza_toppings, require cross-referencing to identify inconsistencies in the toppings listed for various pizzas.


Goals of the Analysis

Data Cleaning: Standardize and clean unstructured columns like ingredient exclusions, extras, and timestamps to make the data usable.
   
Operational Insights: Analyze the performance of runners (delivery time, distance traveled, cancellations) to optimize logistics.
   
Customer Preferences: Examine customer orders to identify trends and preferences for pizzas and toppings.

Inventory Optimization: Analyze topping usage to streamline inventory management and reduce waste.

Improve Decision-Making: Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer satisfaction, streamline operations, and enhance the company’s financial performance.
